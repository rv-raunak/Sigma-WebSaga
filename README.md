# Commit Prefix Guide

To maintain a clear and organized commit history, I follow a set of standardized prefixes in my commit messages. These prefixes help quickly identify the purpose and scope of each change, making collaboration and project tracking easier.

Below is the list of prefixes I use along with their meanings and examples:
To keep my commit history clear and consistent, I use these commit message prefixes:

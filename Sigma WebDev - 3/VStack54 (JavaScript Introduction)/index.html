    <!-- JavaScript is a Client-Side Scripting Language. It helps to add interactivity to the websites. With the help of node.js, we can also use it in backend. Do refer the Tutorial Articles for a full-ledged introduction to it.
    Now, JS can be used for both computing at the server side (backend) and we can also use make it do works with our browser so that it doesn't require to fetch anything from the server then we can do this too (front-end) 
    -->

    <div class="box">
        Hey I am a box
    </div>
    <button>Submit</button>
    
    
    <script>
           //alert("Hello World");      //gives an alert box at the time of loading the web-page

        //Now, this is an example of JavaScript being used in Front-End

        //However, we can also use it in backend (Ex-It can be used at the server-side to run some queries (which is done using MongoDB)) (We'll explore it later)
        
        /* Now, in front-end Java Script is primarly written in two ways:
        -> Using the script tag as you're doing now (It will be used for practicing simple JS)

        -> Other way is to make a script.js file and link it here (Usually used for bigger files and projects)

        */

        //Frontend works by it (Examples)
        /*
        -> To do something after clicking the button
        -> If we have to show warning sign for invalid input in inputboxes like "This email address is not valid" by using conditions like if it doesn't contain an '@' sign so its an invalid email address
        ->And much more
        */
       
        //Backend works by it (Examples)
        /*
        ->We can run JavaScript to make the whole Backend 
        ->We can do server-side scripting i.e. we can run queries on the server, connect to databases, and we can also pull data from there to send it to the client.       
        
        */

        //Thus , in short the role of JavaScript is very prominent and in fact the modern JavaScript is very powerful as we have many functions like map, filter or reduce etc. and makes a lot of things very easy for us. SO we can various amazing things by using JavaScript Alone.

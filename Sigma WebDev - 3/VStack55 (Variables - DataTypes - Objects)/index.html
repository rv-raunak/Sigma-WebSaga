    <!-- Here, we are going to learn about JavaScript Variables, Datatypes, keywords like let, var and const and their usage, then we'll learn about nodejs REPL(i.e. Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) -->

    <!-- Note: For teaching JavaScript Harry is using his handwritten notes (so I must follow it too) -->


    <!-- ECMAScript is a standard of JavaScript which helps the creators of JavaScript to maintain it. Now, in JavaScript new features are added time to time and thus ECMAScript (since its it standard) also has new updates timely. And in accordance with those updates we get new features. We can check the latest features and versions of ECMAScript on Wikipedia. Although as now, most of the modern JavaScript features have been implemented.--> 

    <!-- Variable - A Variable is basically a container which store a value. Now, that value can be number, string, floating point number or in fact that value can also be a JavaScript Object -->

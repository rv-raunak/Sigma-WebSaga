                <p>There are two more ways of adding css but we are just looking at one as of now</p>

                <p>In the first way we can diectly write css into this html file without linking another file</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>We can have multiple selectors having the same declaration(i.e property/key:value). We can have this
                    by using comma ',' between them.</p>

    <span>
        Hello I am span

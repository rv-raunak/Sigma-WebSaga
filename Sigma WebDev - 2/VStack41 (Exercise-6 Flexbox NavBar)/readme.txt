Do check out Harry's solution and in fact Video 43(Exercise-6) as he has done told various new things and I was astronished

Key-Insights that I missed

->Use of Curson:Pointer (New to me)

->We can also look for images and font from inspect 
    ->We can directly take image from its image link (although its not recommeded as it makes our website dependent to another website for image)
    ->for searching anything from code like font-family we can use the filter feature of inspedt element in the styles tab

->He recommended of using exploring the best options for justify-items for flex in order to find that fits the best (And he fixedat space around) and he didin't really use margin to shift elements

->In order align to the downward also made each li a flexbox by giving them a common class which I missed and this in-turn helped him as he was able to centre both the options and arrow and was also able to align them easily together

->in order to keep theoptions and downward arrow the same yet different he placed them inside the same li tag but seperated the text by using span tags (in order to keep the inline property prevalent which also helped him to put margin around the downward arrow )

->Also he used the margin/padding shorthand margin/padding:0 Npx (which allowed him to put margin in both left and right which i kinda forgot about and I was struggling to keep the left and right margin same as I was setting them individually)

->He also modularised everyhting by keep everything in div and even used span when required 

-> He also told about a new webiste to look for svg icons (although he did day that there are many websites for that and we cna use them too)
    -> he searched that website by searching down arrow hugeicons (Hugeicons is a webisite)

->since the svg was long so he didn't make a common class to change its dimensions so he used alt + Click to write the same dimensions at the same time. However, for changing the values he even did a more clever thing as since he had same value for dimensions say height="40" so he selected "40" along with quotes as he knew didn't use it anywhere else and use the change all occurences option to select all the 6 occurences at the same time to change them. (Thus, he selected 40 with quotes sp that no other numeric will be selected (Although for being safe I can select even more like ="40px" or even " height=40px" to keep it safer (in case I don;t remember if I have used thta value before or not)))

            <h2>Relative VS Absolute:</h2>
            <p> They are basically used to modularlise code(for grouping and ungrouping elements). 

            An element set to relative is always related wrt to its original position based on the normal flow and when moved the original space is still reserved for it (as other elements still think that the element is present although it has moved i.e. they still respect its position and the rest of the layout is still intact).
            </p>
<br>
            <p>However, for absolute elements, it is always relaive to its parent and not to its original position in the normal flow and thus it moves wrt to its parent element (that means we can group multiple child elements to the parent element). And infact if the parent is static(which every element actually is by default) then the absolute child element becomes relative to the root element (or the viewport)...similarly if it has not parent then again the absolute element is related to the viewport only.
<br>
            And if the absolute element that is relative to aparent is shifted then other other wll behave as if no element was there originally and now the original space reserved for it will not be there anymore as the other elements will shift towards it.</p>
<br>
            <p>Remember, that both absolute and relative elements don't take any extra space at the newly moved postion , if there are already some elements in the newly moved postion then they will simply float over them like an overlay.</p>

<br>
            <p>In short, whenever we are setting an element as relative then we are setting it up as a potential container for containing abolute positioned child elements. Thus, its like an anchor for grouping and all the other absolute postioned child elements of it will function like its chain.</p>

    <h1>Inline Elements V/S Block Elements</h1>
    <p>They are the elements which take only the width that is required by them whereas Block Elements take the width of
        the whole screen</p>
    <p>Since Block elements take whole width so the next content comes below it only but this is not the case with
        inline element</p>


    <p id="p1">I am Para (Block Element)</p>

    <a href="https://google.com">Anchor Tag(Inline Element)</a>
    <span>I am just a like div but I am Inline element(Span Tag)</span>

    <div id="div">I am Div(Block Element)</div>
    <a href="">Yes div is Block that's why I am below (I am anchor)</a>

    <h2>Will an Inline element always be inline or a block element will always be a block element?</h2>
    <p>NO, this property of an element of either being inline or block is known as its display property. And this
        display property can be changed via CSS which we will look later</p>

    Entities are used to write the tags/things that might collide with the syntax of html
    <hr> <!--this is horizontal line tag-->
    <div>You can refer more about Entities on this like:

    </div>
    <div>
        Example Of Enties:
        This is the code for paragraph &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        We can also put symbols like that of copyright using Entities: <h2>&copy; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaibhav
            Mishra</h2>
        <!--&nbsp; is an entity(Non-breaking spaces) and helps in making multiple spaces as html code considers only single space but by using it you can put longer spaces in between the words-->

        Using Pre-Tag: It is a special tag where everything except (for the above tag represenation) can be represented
        as it is.

        <pre>
This is pre tag


            And it can display spaces and indentation in the same way as mentioned in the code 
            
            But, remember that for showing up tags we must use entities only
        <h2><a href="https://www.codewithharry.com/tutorial/html-pre-tag/#google_vignette" target="_blank">Know more about pre-tag here</a></h2>
        </pre>

        We also have quotation tag that tells the search engine that we are writing a quotation.

        <blockquote cite="source-url">
            Being Better Everyday
        </blockquote> <!--we can style this with css later-->

        There are also some obselete HTML tags that are not recommended to use know as its better to use css instead of
        them. But, its good to at least have an idea about them.

        Now we will be discussing about code tags. These are nothing but semantic tags for displaying the code(be it in
        any language) on a website.

        Below pre tag is used with code tag so that multlines of the code is intact
        <pre>
            <h1>Html code is shown here</h1>
        <code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

        </code></pre>
    </div>

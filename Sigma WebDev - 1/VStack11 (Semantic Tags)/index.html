        This is main area. Semantic tags are only meant for arranging/classifying the webcontent in a structured way.
        Semantic tags are not necessary to use as we can also use div and span tags but using semantic tags we can
        enhance SEO of website as it helps search engines like Google and Bing to understand our website better so that
        they can rank it easily as the content will be more structured and then content can be effectively presented for
        ranking and it helps web-crawlers to easily navigate through the website as each tag tells about the structure
        of the website and where it is stored. Semantic tags are introduced from html5. Also, if the page is structured
        then it will be more easy for the browser to parse the content. Suppose a new feature is used in a browser like
        Bing like read aloud...then it will read-aloud only the main content if semantic tags are used and will not read
        the junk content like home or about section. Also, in case, a preview is generated for the website (like when
        when URL is put on Twitter so ut generates preview) so semantic tags work well there too. So easy navigation and
        accessibility is possible through semantic tags.

        <p>Tip: We can also directly make chnages through css from the Inspect window too ->from the style
            section...however it is temporary styling and resets after reloading</p>
